# FlareUI 1.2

## New

**Unit Frames**
- Portraits on the player, target and focus frames: pick None, 3D or Class Icon in each frame's Edit Mode settings. The portrait sits in a square on the frame's left, or on the right of a mirrored frame. On mirrored frames the 3D portrait turns to face the bars; class icons keep their orientation, and NPCs show the 3D portrait.

**Radial Menu**
- Extra keybinds: up to 5 more keys per character, each opening a radial of its own (Radial Menu settings > Extra Keybind). They work like the main keybind: hold, aim, release, in combat too. A key can only open one radial; giving it to another row takes it from the old one.

## Fixed
- Sync Blizz UI: chat tab message filters and channels were copied but only showed after a second reload. Sync now offers its reload when they change.
- Damage Meter: a threat row could show the previous player's icon flipped or cropped.

# FlareUI 1.1.2

Urgent fixes for dungeons, raids and battlegrounds.

## Fixed
- Tooltips: hovering any unit inside an instance (or in a PvP match) threw a Lua error. Blizzard hides the unit from addons there; FlareUI now finds it another way, or leaves the tooltip as Blizzard drew it.
- Nameplate quest tags no longer error on nameplates whose unit is hidden from addons.
- Unit frames: the quest icon never showed for normal quest mobs, only for the rare "quest bosses". It now shows when your target or focus is part of one of your active quests.

## Changed
- Quest icons are a simple yellow "!" instead of the shield, both on nameplates (Tweaks > Tag Quest Objectives) and on the target and focus frames, where it sits on the right edge. The unit frame element is now called Quest Icon.
- Chat: the Message Formatting options say they work outside instances only, where Blizzard hides chat messages from addons.

# FlareUI 1.1.1

## New

**Radial Menu**
- Radial macros: `/click FUIRadial <RadialName>` (the name without spaces, any case) opens any radial at your cursor, so a radial can sit on an action bar, use macro conditionals ([pet], [mod:shift]...) or be opened by a button of another radial. A macro radial stays open: click a button to use it, or press the macro again to use the button you point at; right-click or Escape closes it. Works in combat.
- Radial Macros group in the Radial Menu settings: how it works, and each radial's macro line to copy.

## Fixed
- Tooltips settings: the Show with Shift option had the wrong width.
- Unit frame auras: the stack count and timer could sit under a debuff's dispel border.

# FlareUI 1.1

A big one: new features in almost every module.

## New

**Unit Frames**
- Five-second-rule spark: after you cast a spell that costs mana, a spark crosses your mana bar for the five seconds your spirit regen is paused.
- Pet happiness: your hunter pet's happy / content / unhappy face in the middle of the pet frame, with Blizzard's tooltip (damage, loyalty, diet). Switch it off in the pet frame's Edit Mode settings (Happiness).

**Damage Meter**
- Threat tab: a second view beside the meter's title, like the chat tabs. It lists your group's threat on your target, highest first, with how close each player is to pulling aggro. It follows the meter's bar style, spec icons and class colours. Option: Threat Meter Tab.
- Right-click the meter's title to choose what it tracks (Damage Done, DPS, Healing...).
- Combat Timer option: how long the fight has lasted, in the title row.
- How to Use tips in the Damage Meter settings.

**Chat**
- Short Channel Names (on by default): [2. Trade - City] becomes [2], [Guild] becomes [G].
- No Bubbles in Instances: chat bubbles off inside dungeons, raids and battlegrounds, back to your own setting outside.
- How to Use tips in Chat > General.

**Tweaks**
- Auto-Type DELETE: fills in DELETE when you destroy a rare or better item.
- Train All Button at class and profession trainers.
- Hide the Quest Tracker in Boss Fights.
- New Convenience group (Faster Auto Loot moved there); Camera & Loot is now Camera.

**Tooltips**
- Item IDs and Spell IDs options.

**Minimap**
- FPS & Latency on Clock: your framerate and latency in the clock's tooltip.

**Radial Menu**
- Cooldown swipes on the buttons, and unusable buttons dimmed (blue when you are out of mana).

## Changed
- Unit frame icons: the leader crown sits at the top-left corner and is a little bigger; the quest icon on the target frame sits on the top edge and is bigger; the raid marker sits in the middle of the health bar on every frame, at half its height. The pet frame no longer shows a raid marker.
- The pet frame is wider by default (160), its right edge in line with the player frame.
- The Blizzard Art Border option is gone.
- The Modules page no longer has About FlareUI and Inspired by (the credits are on the CurseForge page).

## Fixed
- A unit's health bar could show up on FlareUI's own tooltips, such as the chat volume button's.
- Minimap clock: the whole clock answers the mouse (only a small spot in its middle did), and its tooltip shows at once.
